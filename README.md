## Bio

My name is Alex Brown, and I'm a Technical and Content Writer. I've worked most recently in the monitoring space for Uptime.com, writing a range of blogs, support articles, and guides on the Uptime.com UI and platform as well as general industry topics within DevOps, Monitoring, and E-Commerce fields.

With a background in IT and a degree in Medieval History, I bring a unique combination of technical know-how and a love for writing. I lives in Seattle with his partner and two cats, and spends his free time writing novels, browsing second-hand bookstores, and playing soccer.
